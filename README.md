# stringlatin
JAXB generated classes for DIN SPEC 91379 (Lateinische Zeichen in Unicode)

The license of latinchar files is unclear, therefore they are not included
here, but they are publicly available at:

https://www.xoev.de/sixcms/media.php/13/StringLatin%2012.zip

Put the files latinchars.xml and latinchars.xsd into /src/main/resources/com/github/gv2011/stringlatin/.
